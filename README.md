## Homework 1
* [Part A](hw1/README_A.md)

Three lights rotate independently, one around the y axis, one z, one -x = y plane.
The objects each rotate. The rightmost is texture and lit by one light. The middle
lit by a different light, using Gourad lighting. The left lit by two lights using Phong.

* [Part B](hw1/README_B.md)

I used the third edge detection kernel listed on the wikipedia page. Leftmost mouse is 
only the texture, rightmost is only the edges.

* [Part C](hw1/README_C.md)

I used the "Diamond Cycles" cyclic cellular automata with 14 colors.

* [Part D](hw1/Homework1D.md)
